## Main Heritage Sites (1-13)

### 1. Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad
- **Constructed:** 1894-1897
- **Architects:** AC Norman, RAJ Bidwell, CE Spooner, and AB Hubback (for the interior)
- **Cost:** $198,000 (Straits Dollars)

This was the Government Offices of the British Colonial administration. The original building, built in the shape of the letter E, has a front façade facing the padang (now called Dataran Merdeka). At 480ft in length, the two-storey building has a wide arched colonnade running around both floors with seven staircases and a massive porch and entrance hall with its marble staircase in the centre. It was the largest building of its day, constructed entirely of brick and plaster.

The imposing clock tower rises to over 140ft high with a copper dome. The one-ton-bell clock was set to strike the hour and half hour and had a four-sided opal glass dial 8 feet in diameter. This clock was first heard during Queen Victoria's birthday parade in 1897.

It was reported that over 4,000,000 bricks, 2,500 barrels of cement, 18,000 pikuls of lime, 4,000 cubic yards of sand, 5,000 lbs of copper, 50,000 tons of steel and iron, and about 30,000 cubic feet of timber were used in its construction.

Originally known as the new Government Offices, it housed the PWD, Survey Office, Treasury, Post and Telegraph Offices. In 1979, it was handed over to the Justice Department and later refurbished to accommodate the Federal and High Courts. In 2008, it was taken over by the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage and now holds the offices of the National Heritage Department.

While a plaque at the entrance declares AC Norman as the architect, RAJ Bidwell is commonly recognised as carrying out the design, while CE Spooner is credited with suggesting the use of the 'Mahometan' (Moorish) style. If you look carefully beside the main entrance porch, you will see the tops of granite bollards originally used for tethering horses, which appear sunken because the road level is now much higher.

## The History of Kuala Lumpur

Modern Kuala Lumpur has its origins in the 1850s when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah, sent a group of Chinese miners up Sungai Klang to open new tin mines. The early miners landed at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang and established a small trading post.

During the Selangor Civil War (1870-73), the third Kapitan Cina, Yap Ah Loy, emerged as a leader and is attributed to be responsible for the survival and growth of the town.

In 1880, Kuala Lumpur took over from Klang as the administrative capital of the Selangor state. After an 1881 flood, the British administration required that all buildings be constructed from brick and tile.

A multi-racial community grew around Market Square. The Chinese community congregated east of the Klang River. The Malay quarter, Kampung Rawa, was located north, while Indian Chettiars and Muslim traders set up businesses nearby. The British administration was on the West side of the river around the Padang.

The advent of the railway in 1886 brought further prosperity. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States. In 1957, Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the newly independent Federation of Malaya. It was declared a city in 1972 and established as the Federal Territory in 1974.

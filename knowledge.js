## The History of Kuala Lumpur

Modern Kuala Lumpur has its origins in the 1850s when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah, sent a group of Chinese miners up Sungai Klang to open new tin mines. The early miners landed at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang and established a small trading post.

During the Selangor Civil War (1870-73), the third Kapitan Cina, Yap Ah Loy, emerged as a leader and is attributed to be responsible for the survival and growth of the town.

In 1880, Kuala Lumpur took over from Klang as the administrative capital of the Selangor state. After an 1881 flood and fire, the British administration required that all buildings be constructed from brick and tile.

A multi-racial community grew around Market Square. The Chinese community congregated east of the Klang River. The Malay quarter, Kampung Rawa, was located north, while Indian Chettiars and Muslim traders set up businesses nearby. The British administration was on the West side of the river around the Padang.

The advent of the railway in 1886 brought further prosperity. In 1896, Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States. In 1957, Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the newly independent Federation of Malaya. It was declared a city in 1972 and established as the Federal Territory in 1974.

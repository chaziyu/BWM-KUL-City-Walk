    "flyer_text":"This is the oldest existing jewellers in Malaysia. Founded by PH.Dineshamy who later changed the family name to Hendry. Dineshamy originally worked as a harbour pilot in Galle, Sri Lanka where he also sourced and sold jewellery and Ceylonese gemstones to passengers on visiting cruise ships. He left Galle for Australia in the late 19th century, but en route was the victim of a shipwreck; he was rescued and landed in Singapore where he made contact with BP De Silva, a successful Sri Lankan jeweller there. He returned to Sri Lanka briefly but eventually travelled to Kuala Lumpur where he established the Ceylon Bakery (1894) on Jalan Melayu, which offered bread, cake and pastry. Dineshamy's son, PH., established P.H. Hendry Jewellers in 1902 having received the permission and support of B.P. de Silva. Starting with a single showcase in the Ceylon Bakery, business expanded and moved to larger premises, first to 28, Jalan Melayu, and in the 1920s to 2 & 4 Batu Road where it remained until it moved to its present location in the early 2000s. Suren Hendry, present General Manager, is the great-grandson of Dineshamy. The three coats of arms on the company's business card attest to the fact that P.H. Hendry were appointed royal jewellers to the Sultans of Selangor, Kelantan and Negeri Sembilan in the 1920s. Their main business remains gemstones and dealing in gold, silver and platinum. The Hendry family are also well known as philanthropists and supporters of the Sinhalese community and are closely linked with the Buddhist Maha Vihara in Brickfields where the P.H. Hendry Memorial Hall is found.",

    "flyer_text":"Constructed 1912-1915, this was also designed by AB Hubback and cost some $208,000 (Straits Dollars) to build. It replaced the Supreme Courts which had originally been located on Court Hill where today Menara Maybank stands. Here the public entrance faces the river and leads to a grand inner courtyard from which a concrete double staircase leads to the upper floor. The original design of the building had four towers each topped with a cupola [sic] with decorative [sic] buttresses surrounding the base and different types of arches linking the towers on both floors. From the mid 1980s some of the judicial courts were moved into this building. In the late 2000s after the courts moved to their new premises, this has been used by various departments of the Ministry of Tourism and Culture. It now stands vacant but expectations are that it will be restored for new use by Kraftangan Malaysia.",
